TrafficCounter
==============

This express library is meant to count raw traffic (requests) on arbitrary express route handlers.

It is not meant to differentiate the values of query strings or parameters, but rather the expression specified in handlers.

As such, it is best used to determine traffic in core areas of your web page.

It's sole dependency is the node.js mongodb driver and a running database.

Status
======

At this point, the library is in beta stage. The core functionality is there and everything seems to be running with manual tests so far.

Unit tests will follow to provide greater assurance on functionality.

Installation
============

npm install traffic-counter

Initial Setup
=============

Assuming you required the library in a TrafficCounter variable...

First, you need to ensure core collection dependencies by calling the following asynchronous call:

```javascript
TrafficCounter.Setup(<Database>, <Callback>);
```

The <Database> argument, which is a mongodb database connection, is mandatory.

The <Callback> argument is optional. If used, it takes the following form:

```javascript
TrafficCounter.Setup(SomeDBConnection, function(Err) {
    if(Err)
    {
        //Handle error
    }
    else
    {
        //Everything is fine, proceed...
    }

});
```

Alternatively, you can put handlers on the following 2 events instead:

```javascript
TrafficCounter.Event.SetupFinished
TrafficCounter.Event.Error
```

Taking the second route looks like this:

```javascript
TrafficCounter.on(TrafficCounter.Event.SetupFinished, function() {
    //Everything is fine, proceed
});

TrafficCounter.on(TrafficCounter.Event.Error, function(Err) {
    //Handle error
});

TrafficCounter.Setup(SomeDBConnection);
```

Handling Paths
==============

Let's say you have the following paths for which you want to track traffic:

```javascript
app.get('/', SomeFunction);
...
app.get('/Friends/:Friend', OtherFunction);
```

Assume that for the first one, you want to track the traffic per hour for the past 12 hours and for the second one, you want to track the traffic per day for the past 7 days.

You'd adjust your code as follow:

```javascript
app.get('/', TrafficCounter.CountTraffic(TrafficCounter.TimeUnit.Hour, 12, app);
app.get('/', SomeFunction);
...
app.get('/', TrafficCounter.CountTraffic(TrafficCounter.TimeUnit.Day, 7, app);
app.get('/Friends/:Friend', OtherFunction);
```

The above will track traffic for the '/' and '/Friends/:Friend' paths. In the later case, requests to the URL /Friends/Peter and /Friends/Fred will count as the same path.

If you find '/' and '/Friends/:Friend' to be a little ugly, you can specify an alias for the paths as follow:

```javascript
app.get('/', TrafficCounter.CountTraffic(TrafficCounter.TimeUnit.Hour, 12, app, 'MainPage');
app.get('/', SomeFunction);
...
app.get('/', TrafficCounter.CountTraffic(TrafficCounter.TimeUnit.Day, 7, app, 'FriendLookup');
app.get('/Friends/:Friend', OtherFunction);
```

More formally, TrafficCounter.CountTraffic has the following signature:

```javascript
TrafficCounter.CountTraffic(<TimeUnit>, <Length>, <App>, <PathAlias>);
```

All arguments except the last are mandatory.

<TimeUnit> can take the following values: TrafficCounter.TimeUnit.Minute, TrafficCounter.TimeUnit.Hour, TrafficCounter.TimeUnit.Day, TrafficCounter.TimeUnit.Month
<Length> must be a valid integer greater than 0.
<App> must be the express app that the route handler is assigned to.
<PathAlias> is a string representing an alternative (hopefully more user friendly) name for the path.

Handling Errors When Counting
=============================

TrafficCounter.CountTraffic will make the following call when encountering an error:

```javascript
next(<Error>)
```

As a result, it's important to put some error handling (handler with the (err, req, res, next) signature) in order to better control what the end user will see in his browser.

Additionally, the following event will be emited and can be caught:

```javascript
TrafficCounter.Event.RequestError
```
